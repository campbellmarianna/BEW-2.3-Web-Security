    - "using durty psychological tricks to get people to do what you want"
    - "...anytime that I sound smart is because I'm standing on the shoulders of giants, brillant social mechanics, brillant scientists have written fantastic papers about this and if you want to see the background on all of this it all has been written up in Robert B.Cialdini's book "Influence" fantastic work. "

            - People have a need to feel consisent

        Youtube Video Comment:
        "Firaro 2 years ago (edited)
        Many people will perform any trivial task when told to, simply because it's easier than arguing or resisting. But once the person ordering you seems gone then the vast majority will stop performing the actions. The more authority the person appears to have then the more likely it'll be troublesome to resist."

My understanding:
- The features of a hacker is finding weaknesses and doing something about it.
