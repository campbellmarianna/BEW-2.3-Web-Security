Social Good
A person clicks on a video on Youtube (The secret to getting more hits on your Instagram posts.) and every minute or 2 in the video a ad is ran and sends a donation to Saint Judes Hospital.
I have a bag that is labeled Hostess donettes (donuts), my dad comes around and I say I don’t want this snack and offer it to Him. He says yes and I give it to him. The bag has a donut picture tapped to the front and inside are mini oranges from the tropics.

Social good:  Giving the person very important in my life foods that provide minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants that enable their bodies to strengthen his body to fight heal itself (when necessary).

Final Answer 
I have a bag that is labeled Hostess donettes (donuts), I say to my friend, "I don't want this snack, do you want it?" My friend says yes and they received the snack. The bag has a donut picture tapped to the front and inside are mini oranges from the tropics.

The Social Good Part:  Giving the person very important in my life foods that provide minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants that enable their bodies to be strengthened and able to heal itself (when necessary).

## Historic Hacks/Ethical Hacking
### Thursday April 2
https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html
Actor - attempt or able to do mislicious activity
White Hat - Test secuirty
Black Hat - Will steal your information they get access to
Silver Hat - Middle ground (knowledge of both, rather stay in between), not trying to explote
Ethical Hacking - a concept (what I'm doing is it)

Mongo Lock
8 min - 7:04 - 7:12
What is the hack? The hack is a script that gets into the a business application from a Black Hater, the script accesses the database, deletes the data, and creates a ransom notice in a README file.
When did the hacking start? December 2016
How long did it take to be released to the public? Around the first-half of 2017, this caused a second group of hackers to go and start implementing the same hack around the same time it was publicly released.

According to Zynk: The vulnerability itself is hardly new. The issue was first raised back in 2012 and released somewhere around 2015. Also, in early 2015, John Matherly made some noise when he reported finding around 30,000 insecure installs of MongoDB. In other words, this is something that everyone could have known about for a while.

Lesson 1 (Bad Actors):
Knowing The Risks Allow Us To Be Better Prepared
The Explorer 
Phishing - trick people into giving them their account names directly
How it works
1. Set up a server with a login page that looks identical to the one I want to break into
2. Then I will redirect their browser to the real login page where they cal login and think that everything is okay.
3. Then I send a specifically crafted email that looks like it was sent by the real system that will include a handy link however that link doesn’t take them to the real system it takes them to my special web server that is macurrating as the real system
4. By the time they login in I have their
Botnet
Software installer - in an email
What we do
D
Send emails to specific people we want to to target
Get into credit card network and get the data, sel it 
Espionage
Extortion
Embarrassment
Mongo Lock

Questions:
Attacking systems by exploiting otherwise unknown and unpatched vulnerabilities is also known as: Zero-day exploits
What are the primary motivations of the “Hacktivist”? Political, social
Send bo network requests
Botnet - through malware installment (C &C)
What central component is necessary to form a botnet? Command & Control
What is it called when a fraudulent email masquerades as a legitimate communication in an attempt to get a user to reveal sensitive information? Phishing
What is the goal of the “Cyber Terrorist”? Intimidation
 Damage to their enemies
DDOS - Interrupt internet services
Throw entire industries into array
Using phishing
What is the motivation of the bad actor known as the “Explorer”? Wrong: Money Maybe: Notoriety 
Trick people 
I have 
Most of the people will never know
What is the motivation of the “Cyber Terrorist”? Ideology
What is the motivation of the “Cyber Criminal”? Wrong: Intimidation, Maybe: Fame ??
Want money
Target Point of Sells tech
Use Ransomeware
What is the name of the malware that takes over a computer system and holds hostage the disk drivers or other data? Ransomware
What is the primary motivation of the “Cyber Warrior”? Wrong: Fame
Disrupt critical infrastructure
Espionage
Extortion
Embarrassment
Using target cyber weapons to disrupt, damage
Work in military and government
Zero-Day

If it means this we should embrace it or reject it. What would be gain or loose.

## Historic Hacks/Ethical Hacking
### Tuesday April 9
Sanitization - clean up input 

Dangerous 
<script> tag
1 OR 1

Client Side vs 
Use String parser to 
Spaces turn into percent signs
URL Encoding
+ and be converted to %2B
Python function take in any <
String manipulation and not have sanitization on user input can put one’s application at risk for SQL injection

XSS Attacks
Hackers fail one thousand times before they get the big score
If Stay secure from other countries

DomPurify
Dynamic Content - anything user inputs
In medium any code you see
CORS - Request coming from different domains
Nonlinking links

Homework:

You have been hacked! What Do?
Class 04/16/20
Social Media Groups
Sharing your high school first car
Bad Idea to share:
They are your security questions
The person maybe already has your email, name, maybe even phone number and try to pose as you in your online accounts
Don’t be afraid of what they can do now, br aware what they can do in the future
For an enterprise

## How to Send Secret Messages
### April 21
- Midterm grades have to be submitted Friday morning by instructors
- Store a secret message in a message

- Is the safest for someone to come up with their own cypher to encript your data? You need to hire an crptogher because someone more experienced or knowledgable with bad intentions to sit down and figure out the methods to encrypt the data and encrypt all your data for

# Cypher goes by 2
- Only certain amount of Bitcoin
    - The founder said there are only 23 million 
    -  
# Grandaddy of everything - RSA Key
- used to share data over a network in a safe way
- when you send data over it is always encrypt
- How many ways to encrypt somethin

# The highest number that can be represented by 8 bit
