Social Good
A person clicks on a video on Youtube (The secret to getting more hits on your Instagram posts.) and every minute or 2 in the video a ad is ran and sends a donation to Saint Judes Hospital.
I have a bag that is labeled Hostess donettes (donuts), my dad comes around and I say I don’t want this snack and offer it to Him. He says yes and I give it to him. The bag has a donut picture tapped to the front and inside are mini oranges from the tropics.

Social good:  Giving the person very important in my life foods that provide minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants that enable their bodies to strengthen his body to fight heal itself (when necessary).

Final Answer 
I have a bag that is labeled Hostess donettes (donuts), I say to my friend, "I don't want this snack, do you want it?" My friend says yes and they received the snack. The bag has a donut picture tapped to the front and inside are mini oranges from the tropics.

The Social Good Part:  Giving the person very important in my life foods that provide minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants that enable their bodies to be strengthened and able to heal itself (when necessary).

## Historic Hacks/Ethical Hacking
### Thursday April 2
https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html
Actor - attempt or able to do mislicious activity
White Hat - Test secuirty
Black Hat - Will steal your information they get access to
Silver Hat - Middle ground (knowledge of both, rather stay in between), not trying to explote
Ethical Hacking - a concept (what I'm doing is it)

Mongo Lock
8 min - 7:04 - 7:12
What is the hack? The hack is a script that gets into the a business application from a Black Hater, the script accesses the database, deletes the data, and creates a ransom notice in a README file.
When did the hacking start? December 2016
How long did it take to be released to the public? Around the first-half of 2017, this caused a second group of hackers to go and start implementing the same hack around the same time it was publicly released.

According to Zynk: The vulnerability itself is hardly new. The issue was first raised back in 2012 and released somewhere around 2015. Also, in early 2015, John Matherly made some noise when he reported finding around 30,000 insecure installs of MongoDB. In other words, this is something that everyone could have known about for a while.

Lesson 1 (Bad Actors):
Knowing The Risks Allow Us To Be Better Prepared
The Explorer 
Phishing - trick people into giving them their account names directly
How it works
1. Set up a server with a login page that looks identical to the one I want to break into
2. Then I will redirect their browser to the real login page where they cal login and think that everything is okay.
3. Then I send a specifically crafted email that looks like it was sent by the real system that will include a handy link however that link doesn’t take them to the real system it takes them to my special web server that is macurrating as the real system
4. By the time they login in I have their
Botnet
Software installer - in an email
What we do
D
Send emails to specific people we want to to target
Get into credit card network and get the data, sel it

Trick people 
I have 
Most of the people will never know
What is the motivation of the “Cyber Terrorist”? Ideology
What is the motivation of the “Cyber Criminal”? Wrong: Intimidation, Maybe: Fame ??

## Historic Hacks/Ethical Hacking
### Tuesday April 9
Sanitization - clean up input 

Dangerous 
<script> tag
1 OR 1

Client Side vs 
Use String parser to 
Spaces turn into percent signs
URL Encoding
+ and be converted to %2B
Python function take in any <
String manipulation and not have sanitization on user input can put one’s application at risk for SQL injection

XSS Attacks
Hackers fail one thousand times before they get the big score
If Stay secure from other countries

DomPurify
Dynamic Content - anything user inputs
In medium any code you see
CORS - Request coming from different domains
Nonlinking links

## How to Send Secret Messages
### April 21
- Midterm grades have to be submitted Friday morning by instructors
- Store a secret message in a message

- Is the safest for someone to come up with their own cypher to encript your data? You need to hire an crptogher because someone more experienced or knowledgable with bad intentions to sit down and figure out the methods to encrypt the data and encrypt all your data for

# Cypher goes by 2
- Only certain amount of Bitcoin
    - The founder said there are only 23 million 
    -  
# Grandaddy of everything - RSA Key
- used to share data over a network in a safe way
- when you send data over it is always encrypt
- How many ways to encrypt somethin

Key CyberSecurity Terms
Had a door to the house to keep the cold air out, but when someone came in and stole our valuables be put a lock on the door so only someone who knows how to break into locks could break in
Attack Surface:
Any place in our environment that a bad actor can use to gain entry to, or extract something of value from, the places we want to protect
Similar to a house where we had to add a door and a look 
IT Environment
Total Attack Surface
Networks, Servers, Computers, Data Centers, Variety of Cloud Services, Employees, Customers, Business Partners 
/|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\  /|\
Contributing Factors to our total attack surface area.
What can we do about this?
First identify where the Attack Surface are located
Restrict access
To reduce the attack surface
Bugs in software
Keep software patches up to date
